INTRODUCTION
This protocol describes how to screen commercial antibodies by immunoblot using
wildtype (WT) and knockout (KO) cell lysates. Proteins are separated on a polyacrylamide
gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. These membranes are incubated with
commercial primary antibodies and then with HRP secondary antibodies. A specific band is
detected in the parental cell lysis and should disappear in the KO lysate.

PURPOSE
Describe the standard procedure for the activity in scope.

SCOPE
Applicable to laboratory staff performing the described process.
